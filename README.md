# Financial Statement Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing financial statement trends over a five-year period using advanced Excel techniques. The primary focus is to evaluate revenue and cost patterns, derive actionable recommendations for improving profitability, and enhance operational efficiency. The project uses pivot tables, charts, forecasting methods, financial ratios, sensitivity analysis, and other advanced Excel features to present insights effectively.

## Objective
- Identify trends in revenue and cost over five years.
- Perform forecasting to predict future financial performance.
- Conduct sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of key variables.
- Provide recommendations for profitability improvement and operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes financial data spanning multiple years with details on revenue, costs, profit margins, and other key financial metrics essential for analysis.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Ensured data consistency and resolved missing or erroneous entries.
   - Standardized formats for easier analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Used pivot tables to summarize and categorize data by year.
   - Analyzed trends in revenue, costs, and profit margins through line charts and bar charts.
   - Applied forecasting models to predict future revenue and costs.

3. **Advanced Calculations:**
   - Calculated financial ratios such as Profit Margins, Cost-to-Revenue Ratios, and Revenue Growth Rates.
   - Added cumulative profit calculations and rolling averages for revenue.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis:**
   - Created a sensitivity analysis table to evaluate the impact of varying revenue growth rates and profit margins on overall profit.
   - Incorporated formulas for dynamic updates to sensitivity values.

5. **Visualizations:**
   - Interactive charts for revenue, cost, and profit trends.
   - Forecast charts to highlight future financial performance.
   - Conditional formatting to identify high/low performance areas.

6. **Recommendations:**
   - Provided actionable insights for improving profitability and operational efficiency.
